<h2>Welcome to the RFO Imagelib tool.</h2>

<p>All images taken with the RC20 telescope are saved, by default. They become part of the RC20
Image Library. All images are automatically saved to the network drive (R_drive) and are assigned a
unique RFO image number. The earliest images saved in this manner were obtained October 24 in 2021
(2021-10-24). All saved images may be examined and downloaded.</p>

<p>Images are organized and displayed according to the night they were observed. Nights are
identified by means of the UT date. Images are displayed by night, starting from the most recent
night that has images in the archive.  This is the top of the list of nights. Earlier nights are
then displayed in order by UT date. A page can display multiple nights. At the bottom of a page,
click Next to display the next (earlier) collection of nights and images. At the top right of the
window, click Home to return to the most recent night that has images.</p>

<p>Click on an image to display a larger version of the image which includes the image file name,
plus additional features from the FITS header. The file name consists of these components:</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px">
object name, local date the image was obtained, filter, binning, exposure time in seconds, and the RFO image number.
</p>

<p>Click on the image name to select that image for download. Multiple images can be selected for
download at the same time. All the images in an individual night can be selected for download by
clicking Select [All] at the top right of the displayed images for each night. The Download button
is located on the top right of the Image Library window. Click on the Download button to download
the selected images. Multiple nights may be selected and downloaded at the same time. But for
organizing your downloaded images it may be most convenient to download only a single night at a
time. Images will be zipped and then downloaded. Be patient if you have selected a large number of
images.</p>
 
<p>The Image Library may be searched by date and by object name. These search fields may be
specified at the top of the Image Library window. For date searches enter the UT date you wish to
locate in the Date field. The required format is YYYY-MM-DD. Enter a date and click Search. If you
specify a date which does not exist in the library, the nearest date will be selected and displayed.
Images may then be examined and selected for download.</p>

<p>For object searches, enter the object name in the Target field. The object searches are quite
sophisticated. You can enter only a partial or incomplete name, and all possibilities that contain
that segment will be displayed in an expanded Target field. You may then select the desired object.
When you click Search, all the occurrences of images of that object will be displayed and organized
by night. These images may then be examined and selected for download.</p>
