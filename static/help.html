<h2>Welcome to the RFO Imagelib tool.</h2>

<p>Data is displayed for individual nights. Nights are identified by means of the UT date. Click on
an image to display a larger version of the image which includes the image file name. The file
name includes the object name, local date the image was obtained, filter, binning, exposure
time in seconds, and the RFO image number.</p>

<p>Click on the image name to select that image for download. Multiple images can be selected for
download at the same time. The Download button is located on the top right of the Image
Library window. Click on the Download button to download images. Images will be zipped and
then downloaded. Be patient if you have selected a large number of images.</p>

<p>Images are displayed by night, starting from the most recent night that has images in the
archive. This is the top of the list of nights. Earlier nights are then displayed in order by UT
date. A page can display multiple nights. At the bottom of a page, click Next to display the next
collection of nights and images. At the top of the window, click Home to return to the most
recent night that has images.</p>

<p>To download an entire night, locate the desired night by scrolling down. Find the night that you
desire to download and select All, to the right on the line that contains the UT date. This will
select all the images for that night. Then click Download on the top right of the Image Library
window. The selected images will be zipped and downloaded. Multiple nights may be selected
and downloaded at the same time. But for organizing your downloaded images it may be most
convenient to download only a single night at a time.</p>
